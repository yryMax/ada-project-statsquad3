In today's world, where we're constantly bombarded with information from all sides, it's interesting to think about what drives our choices as we navigate through this vast digital space. Consider Wikispeedia, a game that's similar to moving through Wikipedia, where each click opens up new information. What really influences these choices we make? Is it just a search for information, or are our emotions playing a role too?

This is the focus of our project, "Objectivity through the emotional lens: How does the sentiment of Wikispeedia articles affect player game paths?" We're looking into whether the emotional tone of an article - whether it's positive, negative, or neutral - has an effect on where players go next in the game. Our goal is to find out how the emotions conveyed in text can affect the way we interact with digital content.

## Are there noticeable patterns of sentiment oscillation in the paths chosen by players?
we're exploring whether there's a pattern in how players choose their paths in Wikispeedia based on sentiment oscillation. Specifically, we're curious to see if players are drawn to paths with dramatic emotional shifts, like going from an article with a positive tone to one that's decidedly negative. Our approach includes analyzing the overall distribution of sentiment oscillations in player choices and determining if players generally opt for paths with greater or lesser emotional variance than the average level in the game. We're also looking into what factors might influence these choices, providing insight into how sentiment affects the journey through Wikispeedia.
